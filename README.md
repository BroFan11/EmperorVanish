scoreboard:
  enabled: true
  update-interval: 20 # ticks (20 ticks = 1 second)

staff:
  permission: "emperorvanish.see"

vanish:
  hide-from-tab: true
  disable-interactions: true
  hide-messages: true
  hide-effects: true
```

### Messages
Edit `src/main/resources/messages.yml` to customize all plugin messages, scoreboard lines, and formats. Supports color codes and hex colors.

## Dependencies
- [PaperMC 1.18.2+](https://papermc.io/) (or compatible Spigot server)
- [PlaceholderAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/) (optional, for additional placeholders)

## Installation
1. Build the plugin with Maven:
   ```sh
   mvn clean package
   ```
2. Place the generated `.jar` file from `target/` into your server's `plugins/` folder.
3. Restart or reload your server.
4. Edit `config.yml` and `messages.yml` as needed.

## Usage
- Use `/emperorvanish` (or `/v`, `/vanish`) to toggle vanish mode.
- Staff with `emperorvanish.see` can see vanished players and appear in the staff list.
- The scoreboard updates automatically for all players.

## Customization
- Change scoreboard appearance and lines in `messages.yml`.
- Adjust permissions and staff detection in `config.yml`.
- Use internal placeholders or PlaceholderAPI placeholders in messages and scoreboard lines.
